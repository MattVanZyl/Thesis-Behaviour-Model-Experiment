## Requirements

### 1. JupyterLab

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) is required to run the notebooks and scripts in this repository.

Install JupyterLab by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

### 2. Node.js (for LogRat!)

LogRat! is a Vite-based frontend application for visualising the models generated in the experiments.

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Then, follow the instructions in the **Visualisation** section to set up LogRat!

## Experiment Data

The repository contains the following data directories:

- **Raw Data**: Unprocessed logs or datasets used in the experiments.
- **Preprocessed Data**: Data that has been cleaned and formatted for model generation.
- **Diagnosis Data**: Output generated from the models, including the ones ready for visualisation in LogRat!.

## Experiment Instructions

### 1. Running the Jupyter Notebooks

To run the experiments and process data, you'll use JupyterLab. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder where the Jupyter notebooks are located (e.g., `Scripts`).
3. Start JupyterLab by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter-lab
   ```

   This will open JupyterLab in your web browser.

4. The notebooks for preprocessing data and generating models are located in the **Scripts** folder.

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing (Optional)

The raw logs need to be preprocessed for model generation. This step is optional if you prefer to use the preprocessed data provided.

1. Open the `LogMining.ipynb` notebook located in the **Scripts** folder.
2. Run each code block sequentially to preprocess the raw logs and generate the preprocessed logs.

---

### 3. Model Generation (Optional)

If you want to regenerate the models from scratch, follow these steps:

- For **Part A** models:

  1. Open the `ModelGeneration-PartA.ipynb` notebook in the **Scripts** folder.
  2. Run the code blocks to generate the models used in the visualisation.

- For **Part B** models:
  1. Open the `ModelGeneration-PartB.ipynb` notebook in the **Scripts** folder.
  2. Run the code blocks to generate the models.

These models can then be uploaded to LogRat! for visualisation.

---

## Visualisation

LogRat! is used to visualise the models generated from the experiment. Follow these steps to run LogRat! and upload your models.

### Running LogRat!

1. Navigate to the `lograt` folder where the LogRat! application is located.
2. Install the required Node.js packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the URL provided in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:3000`) in your web browser.

5. Upload a model for visualisation:
   - You can choose a model from the `Original Experiment/Diagnosis/Models/` folders or from the models you've generated by following the instructions in the **Model Generation** section.
